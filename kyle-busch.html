<section>     Toyota has been doing business in America for more than 50 years (55 years).

    Toyota has produced vehicles in America since 1986, and Camrys have been built in Georgetown, Kentucky for more than 25 years. The Camry is now also built in Lafayette, Indiana.

    Over 9.5 million Camrys have been sold in the United States.

    Camry has been America’s best-selling car 14 of the past 15 years, and 2011 marked the 10th year in a row Camry earned that honor.

    Camry has been named the most American-made car three years in a row by Cars.com -- with a domestic content of more than 80 percent.

    All Camrys sold in the United States are built in the U.S.

    Toyota’s U.S. investment exceeds $18 billion.

    Toyota has 10 U.S. vehicle and parts manufacturing facilities located in Alabama, Kentucky, Indiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. 

    Toyota currently assembles nine different models in the United States. All U.S.-market Avalon, Camry, Corolla, Highlander, Sequoia, Sienna, Tacoma, Tundra and Venza vehicles are assembled in U.S. plants. 

    Nearly 70 percent of Toyota vehicles sold in the United States are built in North America -- and the domestic content is over 75 percent.

    Toyota is responsible for nearly 200,000 American jobs, including over 1,500 Toyota, Scion and Lexus dealerships and 500 supplier locations in North America.

    Approximately 80 percent of all Toyotas sold in the last 20 years are still on the road today. In addition, 90 percent of all Camrys sold since 1996 are still on the road.

    Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. was formed October 31, 1957, establishing its headquarters in Hollywood, Calif. Sales began in 1958 and totaled 288 vehicles that first year.

From its humble beginnings as an aftermarket parts distributor and ‘speed shop’ in 1979, to one of the most accomplished and acclaimed engineering companies in motorsports, it’s been a meteoric and championship-filled story for TRD, U.S.A.

Since its inception in 1979, TRD has developed cutting-edge race engine technology for a wide range of motorsports activities. The unique in-house operation includes complete engine design, development and assembly, as well as production and development of engine component manufacturing. Additionally, with its entry into the sport of NASCAR, TRD has grown its vehicle engineering capabilities in its new North Carolina-based facility.
