Kyle Busch Racing is the new five-star driving experience at the Los Angeles 
Motor Speedway and the only one where you can get behind the wheel of a 
real Toyota race car. 

An all inclusive driving experience on track that will show what it means
 to be a race car driver.
The concept behind Kyle Busch Racing is simple: a culmination of its founders’ 
passion for racing and years of experience as instructors and directors at
 the most prestigious driving experiences and driving schools in the world.

Now is the time to share this passion.

“I feel lucky because I had the opportunity to race in my life, which is my greatest 
passion, and to drive some of the most beautiful cars in the world” says Ado De Micheli, 
president of the company. De Micheli worked for 12 years at the Ferrari Driving Experience 
in Maranello and Maserati Driving School in Parma, Italy.

“The Toyota brand consolidates all the emotions and performance supercars can give. 
Combined with being a real racing car, it makes our Toyota just exhilarating to 
drive on track. 
Our goal at Kyle Busch Racing is to offer the best driving experience, where the main character is not the car…it is the driver.

The racing experience starts by suiting up in a professional race suit and helmet. Then learn the curves in a state-of-the-art simulator session where the Los Angeles racetrack has been laser scanned to exact specifications. Nowhere else in the world will you find such a driving experience. We knew this experience could only take place on a real track with a real racing car. The real challenge was to develop an experience, from beginning to end, that was complementary to the Toyota lifestyle and synonymous with its name. After having hosted multiple corporate events and team building activities we can confidently say that this goal has been achieved.”

Enrico Bertaggia, CEO of Kyle Busch Racing, explains the difference between the racecar and its street legal version, “The racing Toyota is designed, engineered and built for the track; just for performance. No comfort suspensions, no radio or electric windows. All focused to make it as fast as possible. Top brakes, top engine, carbon fiber body parts, slick tires built to perform, not to last. The result? A machine that responds with precision and immediateness to the driver, giving a unique sensation. Unlike what many would think, driving a well-constructed race car on a circuit is easier than driving a normal car, because it’s built for what you’re going to do. The brakes won’t fade, the tires will deliver more grip, helping you to follow the desired line and the response of all controls is, in general, more precise. What makes the difference is the correct set-up. When a car is as balanced as the Toyota, then it is pure fun. 

We have put all of our experience in setting up the Toyota at its finest to make a car, already famous for its balance, perfect. Drivers will experience this from their first lap at Kyle Busch Racing.
